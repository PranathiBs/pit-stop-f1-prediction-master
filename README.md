# Pit Stop — F1 Prediction Dashboard 🏎️ (MLOps v5.0)

[![Pit Stop MLOps Pipeline](https://github.com/PranathiBs/Pit-stop-F1-Prediction-and-Gran-Prix-calendar--master/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PranathiBs/Pit-stop-F1-Prediction-and-Gran-Prix-calendar--master/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml)

A professional, self-sustaining F1 Prediction Engine. This system is designed for high availability and "forever" consistency by automatically updating data, re-training models, and verifying its own health.

## 🟢 System Status & Verification

To ensure the system is "Working" at all times, we use a multi-layered validation approach:

1.  **Automated 'Smoke Test'**: Run `python tests/check_system.py` locally. This script verifies F1 API connectivity, checks if the ML model is loaded/functional, and validates the Weather API key.
2.  **FastAPI Health Endpoint**: High-level status available at `/health`, reporting model readiness and cache depth.
3.  **GitHub Actions Guardrails**: The [pipeline.yml](.github/workflows/pipeline.yml) ensures that no broken code or corrupt data is ever pushed. If a test fails, the deployment stops.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- OpenWeather API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PranathiBs/Pit-stop-F1-Prediction-and-Gran-Prix-calendar--master.git
    cd Pit-stop-F1-Prediction--master
    ```

2.  **Environment Setup**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Python dependencies
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Node dependencies
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *This command runs both the Next.js frontend and the FastAPI backend concurrently.*

## 🚀 The 'Forever' Data Engine

This project solves the "Data Decay" problem common in sports dashboards:
*   **JSON Caching**: Once a Grand Prix's results or weather are fetched, they are stored in `data/processed/`. The engine checks this local cache first, significantly reducing API latency and preventing "Breaking Changes" from external data providers.
*   **Automated Updates**: Every Monday (via GitHub Actions), the system pulls the latest race results, retrains the Random Forest model for the current season, and commits the updated binaries back to the repository.

## 📡 Core API Endpoints

- `GET /health`: Returns system status and model readiness.
- `GET /api/calendar/{year}`: Full season schedule.
- `GET /predict/race/{year}/{gp}`: AI-generated podium predictions based on grid and current weather.

## 🛠️ Setup & Secrets

1.  **Weather API**: Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` to your `.env` file and GitHub Repository Secrets.
2.  **Local Dev**: 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python tests/check_system.py  # Verify setup
